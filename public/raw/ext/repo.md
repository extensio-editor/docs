To find new extensions you can either search for a specific extension using the search bar in the top right, or you can use the browse extensions page.

Once you have found an extension you would like to install, you can do that from the extensio editor. For more information, see the [installing extensions doc](https://docs.extensio.com/#/ext/installing).
