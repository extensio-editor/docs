# Markdown format

Our version of markdown essentially works the same.
However there are some slight diffrences that are explained here.

## Headings

Headings using the equal and minus signs are not a thing.

## Text styling

Underscores can not be used for **bold** text or *italic* text.

## Notes (Block quotes)

Block quotes are replaced with notes, essentially the same just a diffrent name.

The first line will automatically be considered the note's title, and amphasised as in the example.

Line breaks will also be added automatically in notes.

Nested block quotes are also not a thing.

> Example note
> This is what a note would look like.

## Lists

Ordered lists are made using the numbers.

Unordered lists with dashes.

Lists can **not** be nested.

## Links

You can not add titles to links.

Links are also not able to be made using the triangular brackets.

## Everything else

Everything that is not listed in this file works the same as it would normally.
